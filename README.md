# STM32L - Internship

During my summer holiday I had an opportunity to work as an intern in an embedded systems company. During my stay there I helped to code:

- UART handling - fully working recieving and transmitting, with frame packing and CRC
- TimeStamp module - a simple action exectuion framework, that automaticly executes an assigned function
- Keyboard handling with elimination of contact vibration
  
I also learned a little bit of 8051 assembly.
